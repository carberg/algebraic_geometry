1. Segment with lpp = {x}            Generic Segment
    Basis: {x}.
    P-representation of the segment:
           ( <0>, ( <u(1)> ) ).

2. Segment with lpp = {x^2}
    Basis: { (u(2)^2 - 1)*x^2 + x }.
    P-representation of the segment:
           ( <u(1)>, ( <u(2) - 1, u(1)>, <u(2) + 1, u(1)> ) ).

3. Segment with lpp = {x}
    Basis: {x}
    P-representation of the segment:
           ( <u(2) - 1, u(1)>, ( <1> ) );
	   ( <u(2) + 1, u(1)>, ( <1> ) ).
